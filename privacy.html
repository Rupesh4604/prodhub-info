    <p>
      <strong>Google Calendar Data:</strong> If you choose to sync your Google
      Calendar, our application requests read-only access to your calendar
      events. We use this access solely to display your upcoming events within
      the application's schedule view. We do not store, save, or share your
      calendar events on our servers. The access is temporary and used only
      while you are actively viewing the schedule.
